Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This was our final project from the Le Wagon 9 week intensive bootcamp. 

A version of the Air B&B model this project was created to enable users who have encountered 'writers block' to collaborate on stories from others, as well as adding to others work to help them with their writing.
