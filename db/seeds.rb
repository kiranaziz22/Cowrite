#   And sorry I could not travel both
#   And be one traveler, long I stood
#   And looked down one as far as I could
#   To where it bent in the undergrowth;

#   Then took the other, as just as fair,
#   And having perhaps the better claim,
#   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
#   Though as for that the passing there
#   Had worn them really about the same,

#   And both that morning equally lay
#   In leaves no step had trodden black.
#   Oh, I kept the first for another day!
#   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
#   I doubted if I should ever come back.

#   I shall be telling this with a sigh
#   Somewhere ages and ages hence:
#   Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
#   I took the one less traveled by,
#   And that has made all the difference.",
